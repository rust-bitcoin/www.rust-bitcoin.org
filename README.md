# Website source for `www.rust-bitcoin.org`

While the website is deployed at rust-bitcoin.org there are still missing parts such as the cookbook.
We will be happy to receive contributions adding interesting examples.

Website for the rust-bitcoin ecosystem. The site is built using [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the
[nightfall](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-nightfall/) theme.

Includes a cookbook built with [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/).
