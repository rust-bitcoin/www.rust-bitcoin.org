Hello from the rust-bitcoin devs.

<!--more-->

The "rust-bitcoin devs" is the group of developers responsible for writing and maintaining the
repositories under the GitHub [rust-bitcoin](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin) organization.

We aim to write code that is correct according to the Bitcoin protocol and APIs that are hard to
misuse - **no foot-guns!** We also try to make things fast.

We welcome any and all contributions. Be aware that because of the stated aims above our review
cycle is sometimes drawn out and can be quite particular, don't let that put you off - you too can
be a rust-bitcoin dev!
