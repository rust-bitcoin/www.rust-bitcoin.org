# Welcome!

This book is created and maintained by those involved in the
[`rust-bitcoin`](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin) GitHub organization, contributions are
appreciated. It covers various crates from the org and as such, aims to be useful to developers
wanting to write code in Rust that interacts with the Bitcoin network. It is specifically not
limited to just the [`rust-bitcoin`](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-bitcoin) crate, although
that is a good starting point if you want a one stop shop for interacting with Bitcoin in Rust.

There are a number of good libraries built outside of the `rust-bitcoin` organization that build on
top of the crates covered here, two that you might like to check out are:

- [`Bitcoin Dev Kit`](https://bitcoindevkit.org/)
- [`Lightning Dev Kit`](https://lightningdevkit.org/)

Finally, this book is currently WIP but hopes to eventually cover various topics, including parsing
blocks and transactions, constructing and signing transactions, receiving data over P2P, plus fun
stuff you can do with miniscript.
